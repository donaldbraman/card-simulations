| **Two Pair** | 31,433,400 | 23.4955% | 1:3 | 62.0% | 39.0% | 24.0% | 15.0% | 9.5% |
| **One Pair** | 58,627,800 | 43.8225% | 1:1 | 49.0% | 24.0% | 12.0% | 6.0% | 3.0% |
| **High Card** | 23,294,460 | 17.4119% | 1:5 | 17.0% | 3.0% | 0.5% | 0.1% | 0.0% |

*Win rates shown are empirical estimates that account for shared community cards and tie scenarios.*

### Key Insights
- One Pair is the most common hand (43.82% of all hands)
- Full House or better occurs only 2.80% of the time
- In heads-up play, even One Pair wins about 49% of the time
- In 6-player games, you typically need Three of a Kind or better to have a good chance of winning

### Hand Probabilities with Wild Cards

| Hand Type | Percentage | 2-Player Win | 3-Player Win | 4-Player Win | 5-Player Win | 6-Player Win |
|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Five of a Kind** | 2% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| **Royal Flush** | 2% | 98% | 97% | 95% | 93% | 92% |
| **Straight Flush** | 4% | 97% | 93% | 90% | 87% | 84% |
| **Four of a Kind** | 16% | 93% | 87% | 81% | 75% | 70% |
| **Full House** | 12% | 77% | 60% | 46% | 36% | 28% |
| **Flush** | 9% | 65% | 43% | 28% | 18% | 12% |
| **Straight** | 48% | 56% | 32% | 18% | 10% | 6% |
| **Three of a Kind** | 4% | 8% | 1% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| **One Pair** | 4% | 4% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| **Two Pair** | 0% | - | - | - | - | - |
| **High Card** | 0% | - | - | - | - | - |

*Note: Two Pair and High Card are impossible because wild cards always create at least One Pair.*

### Wild Card Distribution

| Wild Cards | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 7,030,477 | 70.30% |
| 2 | 2,675,850 | 26.76% |
| 3 | 285,487 | 2.85% |
| 4 | 8,186 | 0.08% |

### Key Statistics
- **Average wild cards per hand**: 1.33
- **Full House or better**: 34.61% of hands
- **Royal Flush frequency**: 1.61% (1 in 61 hands)
- **Most common hand**: Straight (48% of all hands)

### Impact of Wild Cards
The low hole card wild rule dramatically changes the game:
- Straights become the most common hand (48% vs 4.6% in standard poker)
- Premium hands (Full House+) occur in over 1/3 of all hands
- Every hand contains at least one wild card (minimum One Pair)
- Royal Flushes are ~500x more common than in standard poker

## Running the Simulations

### Texas Hold'em
```bash
python texas_holdem.py
```
Runs instantly - uses exact mathematical calculations.

### 7-Card Stud Wild
```bash
python seven_card_stud_wild_parallel.py
```
Runs 10 million simulations in ~30 seconds using 4 CPU cores.

For fewer simulations or different core counts, modify the script parameters:
- `num_hands` in `main()` function
- `num_cores` in `run_parallel_simulation()` function
