Texas Hold'em Poker Hand Probability Calculator

This script calculates the exact probabilities of getting each type of poker hand
in Texas Hold'em (7-card poker). Each player gets 2 hole cards and shares 5
community cards, making the best 5-card hand from any combination of the 7 cards.

The total number of 7-card combinations from a 52-card deck is:
C(52,7) = 52!/(7!*45!) = 133,784,560
